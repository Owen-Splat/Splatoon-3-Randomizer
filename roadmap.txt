v0.3 beta issues to fix

- double check that infinite zipcaster in rocket is properly being excluded

- check grizz with randomized enemies
    there was a crash, unsure if it was random, related to flexlion, or just a general rando issue
    also check what happens if the barrier enemy is in grizz, it would be an issue if it blocks the weak points

- make a list of cutscene actor hashes that can just deleted instead of skipping
    even skipping cutscenes is a slight annoyance when it works to just delete entirely
    also, skipping cutscenes can cause other weird issues anyway (blurred camera, clipping through ground)

- text improvements
    not all mission text is randomized
    we should probably also create length groups for the text so that long text does not go where there should be short text

v0.4
- improve logic
    zipcaster and inkjet levels currently have the weapon choices left as vanilla
    they are designed too heavily on those specials
    we will add map objects so that more weapons and specials can complete them

- add weapon selectors to every level possible
    naturally, this will require adding logic to those levels

- experiment with randomizing the base hero special

- add proper icons for the randomized hero and grizzco weapons

- add any new weapons we get

v0.5
- initial side order support (random weapons, kits, biases, chip effects, ink color, music, etc)

v1.0
whenever both modes are in a state im happy with :)
