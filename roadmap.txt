v0.4
- improve logic
    zipcaster and inkjet levels currently have the weapon choices left as vanilla
    they are designed too heavily on those specials
    we will add map objects so that more weapons and specials can complete them

- add proper icons for the randomized hero and grizzco weapons

- add any new weapons we get

v0.5
- initial side order support (random weapons, kits, biases, chip effects, ink color, music, etc)

v1.0
whenever both modes are in a state im happy with :)
